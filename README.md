# projects
A collection of python projects done with data to provide insights. In this portfolio
there are examples of webscraping, and some Machine Learning techniques to showcase the power
ML has in giving insights to users. These are a few recent projects with more to come.
Other projects that I have done include programs such as  Excel, Tableau, C#, and SQL.
